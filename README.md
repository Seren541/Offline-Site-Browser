This is a search engine written in python. You can index, search, and open websites.

Here are some features it is missing / errors it has:

1. Not looped, must run every time or use run.bat
2. Opens with default browser
3. Console only
4. Minor inefficiencies 
6. Links aren't stored correctly
7. Database won't update or delete removed sites, it can only store new ones
8. Doesn't index a lot of things / indexer is very simple
9. Lots of text restrictions due to the way it's written

If it doesn't work for you, its not my fault. Use at your own risk.

However, if you have any bugs not listed here, feel free to add it to the issues section.
