Note: Make sure all folders have no spaces in them

This is a search engine written in python. You can download websites, index them, and search them. 

Here are some features it is missing / errors it has:

1. Not looped, must run every time
2. Have to pip install pywebcopy to run the program.
3. Sites sometimes don't download
4. Opens with default browser
5. Console only
6. Minor inefficiencies 
7. Doesn't download full site, only that page
8. Sites will download wrong
9. Links aren't stored correctly
10. Database won't update or delete removed sites, it can only store new ones
11. Doesn't index a lot of things / indexer is very simple
12. Lots of text restrictions due to the way it's written

If it doesn't work for you, its not my fault. Use at your own risk.
